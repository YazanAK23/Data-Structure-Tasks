Data Structures Challenges in Dart
This repository contains a series of challenges related to Stacks and Linked Lists implemented in Dart. The challenges demonstrate basic stack and linked list operations, including reversing lists, checking for balanced parentheses, finding the middle node, and more.

Challenges Overview
Stacks:
Reverse a List: Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
Balance the Parentheses: Check if a string has balanced parentheses. Return true if the parentheses are balanced.
Linked Lists:
Print in Reverse: Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.
Find the Middle Node: Create a function that finds the middle node of a linked list.
Reverse a Linked List: Create a function that reverses a linked list by manipulating the nodes to point in the opposite direction.
Remove All Occurrences: Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list.
Requirements
To run the code, you will need:

Dart SDK installed on your local machine.
A text editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA) for editing Dart files.
Install Dart SDK
To install Dart SDK, follow the instructions for your operating system from the official Dart website:

How to Run the Code
1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)
If you're using a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine:
https://github.com/YazanAK23/Data-Structure-Tasks.git
cd Data-Structure-Tasks


2.Setup and Running Each Dart File

Each challenge is implemented in its own Dart file. You can run each Dart file by using the following command in the terminal:

dart run <filename>.dart

For example, to run the Linked List Challenge to reverse the list, if the file is named reverse_linked_list.dart, you would run:
dart run reverse_linked_list.dart
